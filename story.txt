As soon as Sringeri got into the town, he went to the local produce vendor.
He asked the vendor if he would buy the bananas.
The vendor said yes.
Sringiri gave the vendor the bananas.
The vendor gave Sringiri money.
Sringiri went home.
As he was walking home, the weird monkey trailed behind him.
The endâ€”or was it?
Yes it was.
Nothing happening with the monkey.
It was the end.
The end.
